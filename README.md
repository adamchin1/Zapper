# Zapper

Some Notes

Run instructions:
- Run Main Method in Program.cs
- Input and Output files are txt and sit in the project root folder /Files

Given more time:
- I would have added a more reliable way to get the root folder of the solution for File I/O.
- More cases for error handling
- Unit tests
- Saved Settings outfile to a Customer / User object
